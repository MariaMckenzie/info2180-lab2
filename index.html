        <h2>Una Marson Biography</h2>

          Born on February 6, 1905, Una Maud Marson, was raised in Sharon Village,
          St. Elizabeth and was the youngest of six children. She attended the
          Hamptons School for Girls, a boarding school for light-skinned and
          upper-middle-class white girls. Marson's years at Hampton helped her to
          become aware of the socio-economic and racial segregation in the society.
          As she grew older, she began to question her colonial education and
          sharpen her skills as a writer. She later became one of the founders of
          the Cosmopolitan Magazine that was officially published by the Jamaica
          Stenographers Association. Marson's position as main editor and writer
          of the Cosmopolitan Magazine enabled her to voice her opinions on many
          topics such as gender equality and racism. She highlighted all, if not
          most of the issues faced by the black Jamaican working-class and
          championed the national literary culture. Tropic Reveries, published in
          1930 was Marson's first book of poetry and At What a Price, staged in
          1930 was her first play.

          Based on the Una Marson Biography, Una Marson was a very complex individual
          with a steady vision. Her complexity comes from her experiences which
          subsequently influenced her choices, thoughts, perspective and literary
          work. Her literary work, especially her poems, gave insight into her
          life and the issues she faced in her homeland and abroad. Her collection
          of poems spoke of the tension between the West Indies and the "mother
          country" and is assumed to have exposed her feelings and thoughts
          regarding certain situations. The text highlighted various themes such as
          identity, feminism, racism and discrimination. In addition to this, it
          also revealed the social and historical context in which Marson lived
          and how it affected her life. Furthermore, the information the text gives
          is priceless. Whereas, the text allows readers to appreciate the literary
          journey of Jamaica and the Caribbean. It gives the reader an insight as to
          the conditions and experiences of our ancestors and how they helped to
          shape the Caribbean we see today. A Caribbean free from colonial rule and
          discrimination. The text on a whole, recollects the life and work of Una
          Marson, a literary heroine, who advocated for equality among all races
          and genders and influenced other Caribbean natives to do the same.

        <h2>The Alice Network</h2>
        <p id="auth2"><i> October 1, 2021 by Maria McKenzie </i></p>

          Louise de Bettignies (also known as Lilli), code-named Alice Dubois, is
          deemed the queen of spies because she ran the Alice Network in World War
          I. The network was one of the most successful rings in World War I that
          provided allies with information about the enemy. This historical novel
          centres around two women from different worlds, Eve Gardiner and Charlie
          St. Clair. Eve Gardiner was a past female spy who was a part of the
          network in France. Charlie St. Clair was an American socialite who
          deviated from the plan of getting an abortion. Instead, she sought her
          favourite cousin Rose who went missing in 1944. Charlie seeks Eve's help
          since they both are trying to locate missing people from the past. Although
          both characters had their flaws, joining forces allowed them to find
          answers and come to terms with their past mistakes and misconceptions.
        </p>
        <p id="p4">
          Based on the Alice Network, both Eve and Charlie are on a quest. Though
          the novel looks at different periods, it shows how the past and the
          present can bring clarity if we look hard enough. The novel explores
          Eve Gardiner's past experiences and how it influences her present state
          and mindset. It also gives insights into the lives of Eve and Charlie and
          the issues they both faced during their youth. The recollection of the
          first world war highlights various themes such as feminism, identity and
          discrimination. It also reveals the social and historical context in which
          they lived and how it affected their lives.  Although their bravery and
          resourcefulness are highlighted in different ways, they inspire readers
          to appreciate the women's journey before, during and after the war.
